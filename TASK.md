## Notes for Development

- Start with the simplest possible implementation for each component
- Use TDD approach - write tests as you build features
- Focus on getting the core framework working before adding advanced features
- Keep strategies simple initially - complexity can be added later
- Document decisions and trade-offs as you build
- Regular commits with descriptive messages for version control
